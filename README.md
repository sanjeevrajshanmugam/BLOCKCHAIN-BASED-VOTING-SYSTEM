# BLOCKCHAIN-BASED-VOTING-SYSTEM

# 🗳️ VoteUp – Decentralized E2E Verifiable Voting DApp

VoteUp is a decentralized voting platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that supports **end-to-end verifiable elections**. It ensures transparency, integrity, and **voter privacy** through a commit-reveal voting scheme. The system supports role-based permissions (admin, voters, candidates), on-chain result validation, and real-time frontend interactions — all in a trustless, decentralized environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Browser UI (React + Tailwind + Framer)
   |
   |---> Web3 Provider (MetaMask)
   |
   |---> Web3Context & Contract Utility Layer (ethers.js)
   |
Smart Contract Layer (Solidity on Sepolia)
   |
   |---> Voting.sol (deployed per election)
```

* **Frontend:** Fully interactive UI for elections, voting, results, and admin actions.
* **Contract Deployment:** Done dynamically from the frontend using a deploy function in `contract.ts`.
* **Storage:** Temporary frontend state stored using IndexedDB (`dexie`).
* **Interaction:** Ethers.js handles commitVote, revealVote, and other contract interactions.

## 🔐 Smart Contract Overview

**File:** `contracts/Voting.sol`

### Core Modules:

| Function                         | Description                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createElection()`               | Deploys new election contract                            |
| `requestCandidateRegistration()` | Candidate applies for a role                             |
| `requestVoterRegistration()`     | Voter applies for a role                                 |
| `approveCandidate()`             | Admin approves candidates                                |
| `approveVoter()`                 | Admin approves voters                                    |
| `commitVote(bytes32 hash)`       | Voter commits a hashed vote (hash of candidateId + salt) |
| `revealVote(candidateId, salt)`  | Reveals original vote during reveal phase                |
| `getResults()`                   | Returns election results after reveal period ends        |

## ⚙️ Installation and Running Locally

### 🖥️ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjeevrajshanmugam/BLOCKCHAIN-BASED-VOTING-SYSTEM.git
cd VoteUp
```

### 🗆 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 🚀 Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> 📝 You do **not** need to manually deploy contracts. The app auto-deploys a new smart contract to Sepolia testnet whenever a new election is created. The actual port/URL may vary; check your terminal after starting the server.

---

## 🧪 Usage Flow

### 1. **Election Creation**

* Admin creates an election via frontend.
* Contract is deployed to Sepolia dynamically.

### 2. **Candidate & Voter Registration**

* Users apply via the frontend.
* Admin views pending requests and approves them on-chain.

### 3. **Commit Phase (Voting Period)**

* Voter casts a hash of `(candidateId + salt)` using `commitVote`.

### 4. **Reveal Phase (Post-Voting)**

* Voter reveals original `(candidateId, salt)` using `revealVote`.
* Contract verifies: `keccak256(candidateId + salt) === committedHash`.

### 5. **Results**

* After reveal deadline, results are computed and displayed.
* Frontend shows:

  * 🏆 Winner(s) (with tie handling)
  * 📊 Vote breakdown
  * ✅ Reveal status per voter

## 🧠 Commit-Reveal Voting Explained

**What is Commit-Reveal Voting?**

Commit-reveal is a two-phase voting scheme:

1. **Commit Phase:** Voters submit a hashed version of their vote (typically `hash(vote + secret)`), committing to their choice without revealing it.
2. **Reveal Phase:** Voters later disclose their vote and secret. The system verifies that the original hash matches.

This ensures:

* **Privacy**: Votes remain hidden during the election.
* **Verifiability**: Everyone can later verify each vote.
* **Fairness**: No early reveals influence others.

---

## ✨ Benefits

### 🔒 Privacy and Secrecy

* Votes are hidden during the commit phase.
* Prevents vote buying or coercion since votes aren’t visible.

### 🗞️ Verifiability

* Each voter can verify their vote via their hash.
* Anyone can audit if results match committed and revealed votes.

### 🏧 Decentralization

* Elections aren’t controlled by a central authority.
* Contracts enforce rules in a censorship-resistant way.

### 🔄 Fairness

* All votes are revealed at the same time, or none.
* Prevents influencing voters based on early disclosures.

### 🔐 Security

| Aspect        | Contribution of Commit-Reveal Voting        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Immutability  | Contracts can't be modified post-deployment |
| Vote Secrecy  | Hash prevents early knowledge               |
| Integrity     | Reveal must match prior commitment          |
| Double Voting | Tracked per voter address                   |
| Transparency  | All logic is on-chain and inspectable       |

### ⚡ Efficiency

* Gas-efficient: only a hash is stored during commit.
* Minimal on-chain data usage.
* No need to store full vote data on-chain.

> ⚠️ Requires users to interact **twice** (commit + reveal)

### 🛡️ Reliability

* **Deterministic**: Results are final once reveals are done.
* **Robust**: Cannot be taken down or altered.
* **Graceful Failure Handling**:

  * Votes not revealed can be skipped.
  * Reveal reminders and auto-enforced deadlines can help.

| Cost                     | High               | Low (post-deployment)  |
| Accessibility            | Limited            | Global (Web3 wallet)   |
| End-to-End Verifiability | No                 | Yes                    |
